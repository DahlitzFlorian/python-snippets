\section{Context Manager}

In this section you will find a collection of self-implemented context manager.


\subsection{Open Multiple Files}

Ever wanted to save a certain text to multiple files?
Well, with this context manager you can open multiple files at once and write a specified text to them.

\lstinputlisting[caption=multi\_open\_files.py]{../standard_lib/multi_open_files.py}

If you run the snippet, it will create ten text files all containing the same text.


\subsection{Temporal SQLite Table}

If you are working with \lstinline{sqlite}, you may find this context manager helpful.
It creates a temporal table you can interact with.

\lstinputlisting[caption=temptable\_contextmanager.py]{../standard_lib/temptable_contextmanager.py}

When leaving the \lstinline{with}-statement, the table is deleted.
That said, you can run the snippet as often as you like, the output remains the same.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Output of temptable\_contextmanager.py]
$ python temptable_contextmanager.py
(1, 1)
(1, 2)
(2, 1)
(5,)
\end{lstlisting}
