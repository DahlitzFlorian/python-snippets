\section{Lists}

Provide useful tips for dealing with lists.


\subsection{Flatten a List}

Sometimes you have a nested list and just want to flatten it.
Here's a small snippet revealing how to achieve right that.

\lstinputlisting[caption=flatten.py]{../standard_lib/flatten.py}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Output of flatten.py]
$ python flatten.py
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Priority Queue}

Image you have a sports tournament (e.g. table tennis or basketball).
Now you want to get the player or team with the most points.
You could store all the information in a list, but if new items are added, you need to resort it.
This can take a significant time amount if the data set keeps growing.
You can make use of a \lstinline{Heap} data structure to implement your own priority queue to auto-sort the data for you.

\lstinputlisting[caption=priority\_queue.py]{../standard_lib/priority_queue.py}

As the snippet provides a sample usage, the following Listing shows you the output.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Output of priority\_queue.py]
$ python priority_queue.py
hello
None
world
None
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Remove Duplicates}

Remove duplicates from a list but keeping the order by using \lstinline{OrderedDict}.

\lstinputlisting[caption=remove\_duplicates\_list.py]{../standard_lib/remove_duplicates_list.py}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Output of remove\_duplicates\_list.py]
$ python remove_duplicates_list.py
List with duplicates: ['foo', 'Alice', 'bar', 'foo', 'Bob']
Without duplicates: ['foo', 'Alice', 'bar', 'Bob']
\end{lstlisting}
