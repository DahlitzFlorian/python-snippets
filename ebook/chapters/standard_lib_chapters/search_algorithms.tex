\section{Search Algorithms}

This section contains implementations of certain search algorithms.


\subsection{Binary Search}

The binary search algortihm is a search algorithm, that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.
It compares the target value to the middle element of the array.
If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found.
