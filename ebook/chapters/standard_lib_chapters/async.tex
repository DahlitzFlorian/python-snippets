\section{AsyncIO}

Since Python~3.5 the module \lstinline{asyncio} provides the keywords \lstinline{async} and \lstinline{await}.
This section provides some useful snippets when operating with them.


\subsection{Time Saving}

Using \lstinline{async} and \lstinline{await} will save you some time especially when requesting data from the internet.
To keep things simple let's simulate requests against a certain API with \lstinline{time.sleep()}.
Listing~\ref{lst:asyncsleep} shows a sample program.

\lstinputlisting[caption=async\_sleep\_sync.py,label=lst:asyncsleep]{../standard_lib/async_sleep_sync.py}

Running this snippet takes around five seconds.
Let's modify it a little bit to run the tasks asynchronously, which is shown in Listing~\ref{lst:asyncsleepmodified}.

\lstinputlisting[caption=async\_sleep\_async.py,label=lst:asyncsleepmodified]{../standard_lib/async_sleep_async.py}

After the modifications it lasts around three seconds.
